Type coercion in JavaScript refers to the conversion of one type to another, either explicitly or implicitly. JavaScript is known for being a loosely typed language (sometimes referred to as 'weakly typed,' though I prefer not to use that term ðŸ˜Š). This means that JavaScript variables can hold values of any type without strict type definitions. Consequently, JavaScript often needs to convert variable types when performing operations.

There are two types of Coercions:

1. Explicit
    
2. Implicit
    

# Explicit Coercion

Explicit Coercion is when we manually convert values from one type to another using built-in functions or operators.

**Examples:**

```javascript
// Converting String to Number
const str = "123";
const num = Number(str); // num is 123 (number)

// Converting Number to String
const num = 123;
const str = String(num); // str is "123" (string)

// Converting Boolean to Number
const bool = true;
const num = Number(bool); // num is 1 (number)
```

## Real World Scenarios

### Form Input Validation

In form fields like text box, we will be getting the values as String. Validation for field can be done with explicit type coercion

```javascript
const ageInput = document.getElementById("age").value; // "25"
const age = Number(ageInput); // 25

if (isNaN(age)) {
  alert("Please enter a valid number for age.");
} else {
  console.log(`User's age is ${age}`);
}
```

### Parsing JSON

In some cases, while fetching JSON data from APIs, it will be String, that we need to convert into Object explicitly.

```javascript
const jsonResponse = '{"name": "Sriram", "age": 28}';
const user = JSON.parse(jsonResponse);

console.log(user.name); // "Sriram"
console.log(user.age);  // 28
```

### Handling Local Storage/Session Storage

Local Storage and Session Storage will accept string values only. If we want to store any non-string value like a number, we will have to explicitly convert it to String.

```javascript
const id=189764
sessionStorage.setItem('id', String(id))
```

# Implicit Coercion

Implicit Coercion happens when we try to perform some operations. JavaScript will automatically convert the types in order to perform the operation.

**Examples:**

```javascript
// String Concatenation
const num = 42;
const result = "The answer is " + num; // "The answer is 42"
const str = 5 + " apples"; // "5 apples"

// Arithmetic Operations
const result1 = "5" - 2; // 3 (string "5" is converted to number 5)
const result2 = "6" * 2; // 12 (string "6" is converted to number 6)
const result3 = "10" / 2; // 5 (string "10" is converted to number 10)
const result4 = "10" % 3; // 1 (string "10" is converted to number 10)

// Comparison Operations
const result1 = "10" > 5; // true (string "10" is converted to number 10)
const result2 = "20" < 15; // false (string "20" is converted to number 20)
const result3 = "5" <= 5; // true (string "5" is converted to number 5)
const result4 = "3" >= 2; // true (string "3" is converted to number 3)

// Equality Comparisons
const result1 = 1 == "1"; // true (string "1" is converted to number 1)
const result2 = true == 1; // true (boolean true is converted to number 1)
const result3 = false == 0; // true (boolean false is converted to number 0)
const result4 = null == undefined; // true (both are considered equal)

// Logical Operators
const result1 = "hello" && 0; // 0 (string "hello" is truthy, so returns 0)
const result2 = "" || "default"; // "default" (empty string is falsy, so returns "default")
const result3 = !0; // true (number 0 is falsy, so returns true)
const result4 = !"non-empty string"; // false (non-empty string is truthy, so returns false)
```

## Common Pitfalls

Type coercion may lead to unexpected results, that will lead to bugs. Understanding on how JavaScript handles coercion can help to avoid such errors.

## Best Practices

* Use strict equality (===) and inequality (!==) operators to prevent any unintended type coercion
    
* Make use of explicit type coercion functions/operators wherever we are sure about the type.
    
* Understand the **truthy** and **falsy** values to avoid logical errors.
    
* Use **Typescript**, which makes the language Strongly typed.
